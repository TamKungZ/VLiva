## VTube for Linux

**Status:** 🟠 _Work in Progress (Soon / Developing)_

----------

### About VLiva

**VLiva** is a program that can run **Vtuber models created with Live2D**, similar to **VTube Studio**.

The project was born out of the challenge of using Vtuber applications on **Linux**, which are often difficult to run and unstable.  
**VLiva** aims to solve this by providing a **100% Linux-native** solution for Vtubers.
